# Python Code Challenges: Lists

## 1. Append Sum
Write a function named ```append_sum``` that has one parameter â€” a list named named ```lst```.
<br /><br />The function should add the last two elements of ```lst``` together and append the result to ```lst```. It should do this process three times and then return ```lst```.
<br /><br />For example, if ```lst``` started as ```[1, 1, 2]```, the final result should be ```[1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]```.

## 2. Larger List
Write a function named ```larger_list``` that has two parameters named ```lst1``` and ```lst2```.
<br /><br />The function should return the last element of the list that contains more elements. If both lists are the same size, then return the last element of ```lst1```.

## 3. More Than N
Create a function named ```more_than_n``` that has three parameters named ```lst, item, and n```.
<br /><br />The function should return ```True``` if ```item``` appears in the list more than ```n``` times. The function should return ```False``` otherwise.

## 4. Append Size
Create a function called ```append_size``` that has one parameter named ```lst```.
<br /><br />The function should append the size of ```lst``` (inclusive) to the end of ```lst```. The function should then return this new list.
<br /><br />For example, if ```lst``` was ```[23, 42, 108]```, the function should return ```[23, 42, 108, 3]``` because the size of ```lst``` was originally ```3```.

## 5. Combine Sort
Write a function named ```combine_sort``` that has two parameters named ```lst1 and lst2```.
<br /><br />The function should combine these two lists into one new list and sort the result. Return the new sorted list.
