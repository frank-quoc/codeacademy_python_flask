# Python Code Challenges: Control Flow

## 1. Large Power

Create a function named ```large_power()``` that takes two parameters named ```base``` and ```exponent```.

If ```base``` raised to the ```exponent``` is greater than ```5000```, return ```True```, otherwise return ```False```

## 2. Over Budget
Create a function called ```over_budget``` that has five parameters named ```budget, food_bill, electricity_bill, internet_bill, and rent```.

The function should return ```True``` if ```budget``` is less than the sum of the other four parameters — you’ve gone over budget! Return ```False``` otherwise.

## 3. Twice As Large
Create a function named ```twice_as_large()``` that has two parameters named ```num1 and num2```.

Return ```True``` if ```num1``` is more than double ```num2```. Return ```False``` otherwise.

## 4. Divisible By Ten
Create a function called ```divisible_by_ten()``` that has one parameter named ```num```.

The function should return ```True``` if ```num``` is divisible by ```10```, and ```False``` otherwise. Consider using modulo (```%```) to check for divisibility.

## 5. Not Equal
Create a function named ```not_sum_to_ten()``` that has two parameters named ```num1 and num2```.

Return ```True``` if ```num1 and num2``` do not sum to ```10```. Return ```False``` otherwise.
