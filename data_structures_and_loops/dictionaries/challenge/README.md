# Code Challenge: Dictionary

## Sum Values
1. Write a function named ```sum_values``` that takes a dictionary named ```my_dictionary``` as a parameter. The function should return the sum of the values of the dictionary

## Even Keys
1. Create a function called ```sum_even_keys``` that takes a dictionary named ```my_dictionary```, with all integer keys and values, as a parameter. This function should return the sum of the values of all even keys.

## Add Ten
1. Create a function named ```add_ten``` that takes a dictionary with integer values named ```my_dictionary``` as a parameter. The function should add ```10``` to every value in ```my_dictionary``` and return ```my_dictionary```

## Values That Are Keys
1. Create a function named ```values_that_are_keys``` that takes a dictionary named ```my_dictionary``` as a parameter. This function should return a list of all values in the dictionary that are also keys.

## Largest Value
1. Write a function named ```max_key``` that takes a dictionary named ```my_dictionary``` as a parameter. The function should return the key associated with the largest value in the dictionary.

## Word Length Dict
1. Write a function named ```word_length_dictionary``` that takes a list of strings named ```words``` as a parameter. The function should return a dictionary of key/value pairs where every key is a word in ```words``` and every value is the length of that word.

## Frequency Count
1. Write a function named ```frequency_dictionary``` that takes a list of elements named ```words``` as a parameter. The function should return a dictionary containing the frequency of each element in ```words```.

## Unique Values
1. Create a function named ```unique_values``` that takes a dictionary named ```my_dictionary``` as a parameter. The function should return the number of unique values in the dictionary.

## Count First Letter
1. Create a function named ```count_first_letter``` that takes a dictionary named ```names``` as a parameter. ```names``` should be a dictionary where the key is a last name and the value is a list of first names. For example, the dictionary might look like this:
<br />```names = {"Stark": ["Ned", "Robb", "Sansa"], "Snow" : ["Jon"], "Lannister": ["Jaime", "Cersei", "Tywin"]}```
<br />The function should return a new dictionary where each key is the first letter of a last name, and the value is the number of people whose last name begins with that letter.
<br /><br />So in example above, the function would return:
<br /><br />```{"S" : 4, "L": 3}```
