# Using Dictionaries

1. We have provided a pack of tarot cards, ```tarot```. You are going to do a three card spread of your past, present, and future.
<br /><br />Create an empty dictionary called ```spread```.

2. The first card you draw is card 13. Pop the value assigned to the key ```13``` out of the ```tarot``` dictionary and assign it as the value of the ```"past"``` key of ```spread```.

3. The second card you draw is card 22. Pop the value assigned to the key 22 out of the ```tarot``` dictionary and assign it as the value of the ```"present"``` key of ```spread```.

4. The third card you draw is card 10. Pop the value assigned to the key 10 out of the ```tarot``` dictionary and assign it as the value of the ```"future"``` key of ```spread```.

5. Iterate through the items in the ```spread``` dictionary and for each key: value pair, print out a string that says:
<br />```Your {key} is the {value} card.```

6. Congratulations! You have learned about how to modify and use dictionaries.
