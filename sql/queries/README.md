# New York Restaurants

We have put together a table of restaurants called nomnom and we need your help to answer some questions. Use the SQL commands you just learned and find the best dinner spots in the city.

## Write the following queries:

1. Start by getting a feel for the ```nomnom``` table:
```SELECT * FROM nomnom;```
<br /><br />What are the column names?

2. What are the distinct ```neighborhoods```?

3. What are the distinct ```cuisine``` types?

4. Suppose we would like some ```Chinese``` takeout.
<br /><br />What are our options?

5. Return all the restaurants with ```reviews``` of 4 and above.

6. Suppose Abbi and Ilana want to have a fancy dinner date.
<br /><br />Return all the restaurants that are ```Italian and $$$```.

7. Your coworker Trey can’t remember the exact name of a restaurant he went to but he knows it *contains* the word ‘meatball’ in it.
<br /><br />Can you find it for him using a query?

8. Let’s order delivery to the house!
<br /><br />Find all the close by spots in ```Midtown, Downtown or Chinatown```.
<br /><br />(```OR``` can be used more than once)

9. Find all the ```health``` grade pending restaurants (empty values).

10. Create a Top 10 Restaurants Ranking based on ```review```s.

11. Use a ```CASE``` statement to change the rating system to:
  * ```review > 4.5``` is Extraordinary
  * ```review > 4``` is Excellent
  * ```review > 3``` is Good
  * ```review > 2``` is Fair
  * Everything else is Poor
<br /><br />Don’t forget to rename the new column!
