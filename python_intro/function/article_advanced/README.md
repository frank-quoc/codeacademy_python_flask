# Advanced Python Code Challenges: Functions

## 1. First Three Multiples

Write a function named ```first_three_multiples()``` that has one parameter named ```num```.

This function should print the first three multiples of ```num```. Then, it should return the third multiple.

For example, ```first_three_multiples(7)``` should print ```7```, ```14```, and ```21``` on three different lines, and return ```21```.

## 2. Tip

Create a function called ```tip()``` that has two parameters named ```total``` and ```percentage```.

This function should return the amount you should tip given a total and the percentage you want to tip.

## 3. Bond, James Bond
Write a function named ```introduction()``` that has two parameters named ```first_name``` and ```last_name```.

The function should return the ```last_name```, followed by a comma, a space, ```first_name``` another space, and finally ```last_name```.

## 4. Dog Years
Some say that every one year of a human’s life is equivalent to seven years of a dog’s life. Write a function named ```dog_years()``` that has two parameters named ```name``` and ```age```.

The function should compute the age in dog years and return the following string:

```"{name}, you are {age} years old in dog years"```

Test this function with your name and your age!

## 5. All Operations

Create a function named ```lots_of_math()```. This function should have four parameters named ```a```, ```b```, ```c```, and ```d```. The function should print 3 lines and return 1 value.

First, print the sum of ```a``` and ```b```.

Second, print ```d``` subtracted from ```c```.

Third, print the first number printed, multiplied by the second number printed.

Finally, *return* the third number printed mod ```a```.
