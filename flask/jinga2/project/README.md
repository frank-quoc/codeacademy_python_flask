# Tourist Attractions

Whenever you travel it is fun to make a list of places you want to visit. The application you are about to create looks at making this list and organizing locations into 3 categories: recommended places to visit, decided places to visit and places that have been visited. Within each category you will have the option to move a location up to the next category and also remove a location. Lastly, there is also the option to add new locations to any of the categories.

The application consists of 7 files, but we will only work on 3 of them. Let’s go over the files we won’t be working on:

**/static/styles.css**: Basic css files to give the application some style and show off the benefits of template inheritance.

**/templates/base.html**: Template header file that the main template file will inherit from.

**data.csv**: Dummy data we will use to show of the functionality of the application as we build it.

**location.py**: A module the application will rely on to add, modify and delete location data. Our application will instantiate a Locations() class from this module. With this instance we will rely on 3 methods:
  * ```add()```: Add a location to the data
  * ```moveup()```: Move the location up one category
  * ```delete()```: Delete a location from the data

The files we will be working with are as follows:

**app.py**: The Flask application which consists of 3 routes:
  * ```locations()```: The main route which will return return content associated with each category of location. This route is also responsible for handling the changing of categories and deletion of locations.
  * ```add_location()```: A form handling route which will process the add location form and then redirect back to the ```locations()``` route.
  * ```index()```: This route is the same path as the ```locations()``` route but without a category variable. It will automatically redirect to the recommended page of the ```locations()``` route.

## Tasks

### render_template() and Template Variables

1. To start let’s get some content in the web browser.
<br />In **app.py** replace the empty string in the return statement of the ```locations()``` route with a call to ```render_template()```, using **locations.html** as an argument.

2. Good job. Our web content doesn’t look like much, just a couple buttons that are part of a web form. In order to work on our template we’ll need to create some template variables and assign the application data to them. Currently our application data consists of:
  * ```category```: The URL string variable that defines the current category page.
  * ```categories```: A dictionary with the ```category``` string as the keys and display ready categories as the items.
  * ```locations```: A list of ```Location()``` objects as defined in **locations.py**. This is a list of only the locations associated with the string variable ```category```.

<br />In **app.py** add 3 variables using keyword arguments:
  1) Create template variable ```category``` and assign it the app variable ```category```
  2) Create template variable ```categories``` and assign it the app variable ```categories```
  3) Create template variable ```locations``` and assign it the app variable ```locations```

### Populate the Template

3. With access to the three variables, we can start work on the template. Let’s start with the heading of the page. We will use the ```category``` and ```categories``` variables to display a string for the page heading.
<br /><br />Inside the ```<h1>``` tags in **locations.html** insert the ```categories``` dictionary using the ```category``` string as a key. Be sure to use expression delimiters ```{{ }}```.
<br /><br />When you are done, if you want to change the heading replace “recommended” at the end of the URL in the browser component with “tovisit” or “visited”. These are the 3 category pages we’ll be working with in this project.

4. Since we have a heading that tells us what category page we’re on, let’s create an easy way to move from page to page by creating a Navbar.

<br />In **locations.html** implement the Navbar:
  1) Inside the ```<div class="navbar">``` tags create a ```for``` loop that surrounds the ```<a>``` tag
  2) Iterate through the keys and values of ```categories``` using the ```items()``` object method
  3) Set the loop variables ```category``` as each key and ```label``` as each value
  4) Inside the ```for``` loop, set the ```href``` attribute to ```category``` and the text of the link as ```label```
<br /><br />**Be sure to:**
  * Close the for loop
  * Use statement delimiters ```{% %}``` with the for loops
  * Use expression delimiters ```{{ }}``` for the standalone variables

5. Great work! You can now move to each category page using the Navbar. Let’s now populate the list of locations in each category using the ```locations``` variable.
<br />In **locations.html** implement the locations list:
  1) Inside the ```<tbody class="loctable">``` tags create a ```for``` loop that surrounds the ```<tr>``` tags
  2) Iterate through the objects in ```locations``` and define a loop variable ```location```
  3) Inside the ```<td class="loc">``` tags insert the ```name``` attribute of the ```location``` object
  4) Inside the ```<td class="desc">``` tags insert the ```description``` attribute of the ```location``` object
<br /><br />**Be sure to:**
  * Close the for loop
  * Use statement delimiters ```{% %}``` with the for loops
  * Use expression delimiters ```{{ }}```

6. In the web browser component, to the right of each location description is a pair of buttons: one to move the location up one and one to delete the location. In the template these are <input type="submit" tags which are in the <form> that is inside the 3rd <td> tag. We need to add a little more info to the form in order for our application to work.
<br /><br />In locations.html add the location name to each of the input elements. You can do this by setting the name attribute for each <input type="submit" in the form to the name attribute of the location object.
** Be sure to:**
<br /><br />Use expression delimiters {{ }}

7. We now have a clear heading to tell us what category page we’re on, a Navbar, a list of locations and buttons to perform actions on our locations. The button functionality is unnecessary for the visited locations, so let’s keep them from appearing on that page.
<br /><br />In locations.html implement an if statement to only have the Move Up and Delete buttons on the “recommended” and “tovisit” pages:
  1) Inside the <td class="btns"> tags create an if statement that surrounds the <form> tags
  2) The if condition should check if the category attribute of the location object is in this list: ["recommended", "tovisit"]
<br /><br />**Be sure to:**
  * Close the if statement
  * Use statement delimiters {% %} with the if statement

8. Now that the first part of the template is finished, let’s use inheritance to complete the template and add some styling to the page.
<br /><br />In locations.html inherit from another template:
  1) At the top of locations.html insert an extends statement that extends base.html
  2) Now surround the rest of the content in locations.html with a block statement named content
<br /><br />**Be sure to:**
  * Surround the filename with quotes
  * Close the block statement
  * Use statement delimiters {% %} with the extends and block statements

### Handle the Move Up and Delete Form
9. When the user pushes one of the location form buttons, a request will be sent to the server with name and value attributes of the associated <input>. One way to test for a form submission in our application is to test the method attribute of the request object. If the method is "POST" we know a form has been submitted.
<br /><br />In app.py test for a form submission. Inside the locations() route function replace the False condition of the if statement with a check that the request object’s method attribute equals "POST"

10. Excellent! Now we need to collect the data in order to process it. If you look in the locations() route function of app.py you will see that some of the data processing has been done already. The two things to know about the submitted data are that the form attribute of the request object is a dictionary and it will only contain one key-value pair within it. Knowing this we can use the items() method to extract that pair using a single line of code.
<br /><br />In app.py collect the name and value data from the submitted form. Replace the [(None, None)] statement with the output of the items() method of the request objects form attribute.
<br /><br />When you are done you can test out the functionality by clicking the buttons next to each location. If you delete all the data you can refresh it by running the code again.

### Create A Form in Python
11. Amazing! Already this is a properly functioning application.
<br /><br />Now it is time for us to create a form to add a location. We’ll define the form in the forms.py file and add a name field, a description field, radio buttons for the category and a submit button.
<br /><br />In forms.py start by defining the form and adding a StringField
  1) Create a form class named AddLocationForm() that inherits from FlaskForm
  2) Define an attribute name and assign it an instance of StringField() with the label "Location Name" and a DataRequired() validator.

12. Good job! Now let’s complete the form.
<br /><br />In forms.py create 3 more field attributes:
  1) Define an attribute description and assign it an instance of TextAreaField() with the label "Location Description" and a DataRequired() validator
  2) Define an attribute category and assign it an instance of RadioField() with the label "Category" and set choices equal to the defined variable categories
  3) Define an attribute submit and assign it an instance of SubmitField() with the label "Add Location"

13. Now that the form is done let’s set it up in our application so we can implement it in the template.
<br /><br />In app.py import the form and assign it to a template variable:
  1) Write an import statement that imports AddLocationForm from the forms file. Reference the locations import statement if necessary.
  2) Note that app.config['SECRET_KEY'] is already set. Remember this is necessary to protect against a Cross-Site Request Forgery attack
  3) Now define a template variable in the call to render_template() within the locations() route. The template variable should be named add_location and assign it an instance of AddLocationForm()

### Implement the Form in the Template
14. Now that we have access to the form in the template we need to tell the form what route will be handling the submission. We also need to implement the other part of the CSRF protection by inserting the form’s hidden_tag() method.
<br /><br />In locations.html initialize the add location form:
  1) Inside the <form class="addform"> tag set the action attribute to url_for() with the add_location route as an argument
  2) On the following line use the form template variable add_location and call the hidden_tag() method
<br /><br />**Be sure to:**
  * Use url_for() inside double quotes
  * Use single quotes for the route function name
  * Use expression delimiters {{ }}
 
15. The structure of the form is created using an HTML table. The first row will be for the labels, the second for the fields and the third for the submit button.
<br /><br />In locations.html populate the first row of the table with the field labels:
  1) Insert the name field label into the first <td> tag using the add_location template variable
  2) Insert the description field label into the second <td> tag using the add_location template variable
  3) Insert the category field label into the third<td> tag using the add_location template variable
<br /><br />**Be sure to:**
  * Use expression delimiters {{ }}

16. Now we’ll move onto inserting the name and description fields into the second row of the table.
<br /><br />In locations.html start to populate the second row of the table with the below fields:
  1) Insert the name field into the first <td> tag of the second row using the add_location template variable
  2) Insert the description field into the second <td> tag of the second row using the add_location template variable
<br /><br />**Be sure to:**
  * Use expression delimiters {{ }}

17. For the category RadioField() buttons we need to iterate through the variable to insert the button elements
<br /><br />In locations.html populate the third <td> column of the second row of the table with the RadioField() elements:
  1) Create a for loop inside the third <td> tag in the second row, making sure to surround the <div> tags
  2) Iterate through the category field using the add_location template variable and create a loop variable button
  3) Inside the <div> tags insert the field using the loop variable button
  4) On the same line insert the field label using the loop variable button
<br /><br />**Be sure to:**
  * Close the for loop
  * Use statement delimiters {% %} with the for loops
  * Not use parentheses () when iterating through the category variable
  * Use expression delimiters {{ }} for the standalone variables

18. Now let’s finish the form with the submit button.
<br /><br />In locations.html populate the third row with an add_location button. Insert the submit field into the single <td> tag of the third row using the add_location template variable.
**Be sure to:**
  * Use expression delimiters {{ }}

### Collect Form Data and Finalize Applicaiton

19. Great work! Now let’s finish the application off by implementing the form collection.
<br /><br />In app.py inside the add_location route function create a form instance and validate the submission:
  1. Create an AddLocationForm instance and assign it to a variable named add_form
  2. Replace the True condition with the form instance’s validate_on_submit() function

20. Now its time to collect the data!
<br /><br />In app.py inside the add_location() route and within the if statement, collect the form data:
  1) Replace the None and assign the variable name to the name field data
  2) Replace the None and assign the variable description to the description field data
  3) Replace the None and assign the variable category to the category field data

21. When a location is added we want to redirect to the category page the location was added. We will also set up a redirect from the / path without a variable.
<br /><br />In app.py use redirect() to complete the application flow:
  1) In the add_location() route function replace the empty string in the return statement with redirect()
  2) As the argument for redirect use url_for() and pass the locations route function and set the category keyword argument to the local variable category. Set the _external and _scheme keyword arguments to load an HTTPS URL.
  3) In the index() route function replace the empty string in the return statement with redirect()
  4) As the argument for redirect use url_for() and pass the locations route function and set the category keyword argument to "recommended". Set the _external and _scheme keyword arguments to load an HTTPS URL.
