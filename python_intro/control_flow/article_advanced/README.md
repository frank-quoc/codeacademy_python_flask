# Advanced Python Code Challenges: Control Flow

## 1. In Range
Create a function named ```in_range()``` that has three parameters named ```num, lower, and upper```.<br />

<br />The function should return ```True``` if ```num``` is greater than or equal to ```lower``` and less than or equal to ```upper```. Otherwise, return ```False```.

## 2. Same Name
Create a function named ```same_name()``` that has two parameters named ```your_name``` and ```my_name```.<br />

<br />If our names are identical, return ```True```. Otherwise, return ```False```.

## 3. Always False

Create a function named ```always_false()``` that has one parameter named ```num```.<br />

<br />Using an if statement, your variable ```num```, and the operators ```>```, and ```<```, make it so your function will return ```False``` no matter what number is stored in ```num```.<br />

<br />An if statement that is always false is called a contradiction. You will rarely want to do this while programming, but it is important to realize it is possible to do this.

## 4. Movie Review
Create a function named ```movie_review()``` that has one parameter named ```rating```.<br />

<br />If ```rating``` is less than or equal to ```5```, return ```"Avoid at all costs!"```. If ```rating``` is between ```5 and 9```, return ```"This one was fun."```. If ```rating is 9``` or above, return ```"Outstanding!"```

## 5. Max Number
Create a function called ```max_num()``` that has three parameters named ```num1, num2, and num3```.<br />

<br />The function should return the largest of these three numbers. If any of two numbers tie as the largest, you should return ```"It's a tie!"```.
