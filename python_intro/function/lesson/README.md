# Introduction to Functions

## Review

Great! So far you have learned:
  * How to write a function
  * How to give a function inputs
  * How to return values from a function
  * What scope means
Let’s practice these concepts again so that you won’t forget them!

## Instructions

1. Define a function called ```repeat_stuff``` that takes in two inputs, ```stuff```, and ```num_repeats```. We will want to make this function print a string with ```stuff``` repeated ```num_repeats``` amount of times. For now, only put an empty ```print``` statement inside the function.

2. Outside of the function, call ```repeat_stuff```. You can use the value ```"Row "``` for ```stuff``` and ```3``` for ```num_repeats```.

3. Change the ```print``` statement inside ```repeat_stuff``` to a ```return``` statement instead. It should return ```stuff*num_repeats```.

4. Give the parameter ```num_repeats``` a default value of ```10```.

5. Add ```repeat_stuff("Row ", 3)``` and the string ```"Your Boat. "``` together and save the result to a variable called ```lyrics```.

6. Create a variable called ```song``` and assign it the value of ```repeat_stuff``` called with the singular input ```lyrics```.

7. Print ```song```.

Good job!
